# DEV-SAMPLES-C-PM-Dialog
This program demonstrates how to associate a pop-up window with a standard window.  The pop-up window is defined as a dialog template in a resource file.

This program displays a standard window.  The action bar contains a single choice:  Options.  The Options pull-down contains a choice that displays a pop-up window which contains an entry field, and OK and Cancel pushbuttons.  When the user types a place name in the entry field and selects OK, the pop-up window disappears, and the place name is displayed at the end of the text "You live in".

This sample is part of the IBM OS/2 Toolkit for OS/2.
